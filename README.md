# space-invaders-game

An .NET Windows Forms application that is a simplified clone of the Space Invaders game. The user can move their character using the arrow keys and shoot using the spacebar key. The game includes music and sound effects for shooting. At the end of each game, a second form appears showing the high scores list.

Note: The music used in the game may be subject to copyright, but it is used only for personal and educational purposes. For the full experience, it is recommended to wear headphones:)
